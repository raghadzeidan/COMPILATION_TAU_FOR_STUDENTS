\section{Introduction}
We continue our journey of building a compiler
for the invented object oriented language RioMare.
Remember that the entire specification of RioMare appears
inside the relevant folder of the course website.
In order to make this document self contained,
all the information needed to complete the third exercise is brought here again.

% SECTION :: Programming Assignment %

\section{Programming Assignment}
The third exercise implements a semantic analyzer that
recursively scans the AST produced by
\href{http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/}{CUP},
and checks if it contains any semantic errors.
The input for the semantic analyzer is a (single) text file containing a RioMare program,
and the output is a (single) text file indicating whether the input program
is semantically valid or not.
In addition to that, whenever the input program is valid semantically,
the semantic analyzer will add meta data to the abstract syntax tree,
which is needed for later phases (code generation and optimization).
The added meta data content will not be checked in exercises $3$,
but the best time to design and implement this addition is
exercise $3$.

\section{The RioMare Semantics}
This section describes the semantics of RioMare,
and provides a multitude of legal and illegal example programs.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SUB-SECTION :: Types %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Types}
The RioMare programming language defines two native types: integers and strings.
In addition, it is possible to define a class by specifying its data members and methods.
Also, given an existing type \verb"T", one can define an array of \verb"T"'s.
Note, that defining classes and arrays is only possible in the uppermost (global) scope.
The exact details follow.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SUB-SUB-SECTION :: Classes %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Classes}
\label{subsubsection_Classes}
Classes contain data members and methods,
and can only be defined in the uppermost (global) scope.
They can refer to/extend only previously defined classes,
to ensure that the class hierarchy has a tree structure.
Following the same concept,
a method \verb"M1" can \textit{not} refer to a method \verb"M2",
whenever \verb"M2" is defined after \verb"M1" in the class.
In contrast to all that,
a method \verb"M" \textit{can} refer to a data member \verb"d",
even if \verb"d" is defined \textit{after} \verb"M" in the class.
Table \ref{Table_Code_Examples_Use_Before_Def} summarizes these facts.

\paragraph{Methods overloading} is \textit{illegal} in RioMare,
with the obvious exception of overriding a method in a derived class.
Similarly, it is illegal to define a variable with the same name of
a previously defined variable (shadowing), or a previously defined method.

% SUB-SUB-SECTION :: Arrays %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Arrays}
\label{subsubsection_Arrays}
Arrays can only be defined in the uppermost (global) scope.
They are defined with respect to some previously defined type, as in the following example:
\[
\verb"ARRAY IntArray = int[]"
\]
Defining an integer matrix, for example, is possible as follows:
\[
\verb"ARRAY IntArray = int[] ARRAY IntMat = IntArray[]"
\]
In addition, any place in the program that semantically allows an expression of type array,
should semantically allow \verb"nil" instead. For instance,
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
\hline
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\verb"ARRAY IntArray = int[]"                &    \\
\verb"void F(IntArray A){ PrintInt(A[8]); }" & OK \\
\verb"void main(){ F(nil); }"               &    \\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{nil sent instead of an integer array is semantically allowed.
\label{Table_Code_Examples_nil_Instead_Of_Any_Array}}
\end{table}
\paragraph{Note} that allocating arrays with the new operator
must be done with an \textit{integral size}.
Similarly, accessing an array entry is semantically valid
only when the \textit{subscript expression has an integer type}.
Note further that if two arrays of type \verb"T" are defined,
they are \textit{not} interchangeable:

\label{subsection_Assignments}
Assigning an expression to a variable is clearly legal whenever the two have the same type.
In addition, following the concept in \ref{subsubsection_Classes},
if class \verb"Son" is derived from class \verb"Father",
then a variable of type \verb"Father" can be assigned an expression
of type \verb"Son".
Furthermore, following the concept in \ref{subsubsection_Classes} and \ref{subsubsection_Arrays},
assigning \verb"nil" to array and class variables is legal.
In contrast to that, assigning \verb"nil" to int and string variables is \textit{illegal}.
To avoid an overly complex semantics,
we will enforce a strict policy of initializing data members inside classes:
a declared data member inside a class can be initialized \textit{only with a constant value}
(that matches its type). Specifically, only constant integers, strings and \verb"nil"
can be used, and even a simple expression like $5+6$ is forbidden.
Table \ref{Table_Code_Examples_Assignments} summarizes these facts.

\subsection{Return Statements}
\label{subsection_Return_Statements}
According to the syntax of RioMare, return statements can only be found inside functions.
Since functions can \textit{not} be nested,
it follows that a return statement belongs to \textit{exactly one} function.
when a function \verb"foo" is declared to have a \verb"void" return type,
then all of its return statements must be \textit{empty} (\verb"return;").
In contrast, when a function \verb"bar" has a non void return type \verb"T",
then a return statement inside \verb"bar" must be \textit{non empty},
and the type of the returned expression must match \verb"T".

\subsection{Equality Testing}
\label{subsection_Equality_Testing}
Testing equality between two expressions is legal whenever the two have the same type.
In addition, following the same reason in \ref{subsection_Assignments},
if class \verb"Son" is derived from class \verb"Father",
then an expression  of type \verb"Father" can be
tested for equality with an expression of type \verb"Son".
Furthermore, any class variable or array variable can be tested for equality with \verb"nil".
But, in contrast, it is \textit{illegal} to compare a string variable to \verb"nil".
The resulting type of a semantically valid comparison is the primitive type int.

\subsection{Binary Operations}
\label{subsection_Binary_Operations}
Most binary operations $(-,*,/,<,>)$ are performed only between integers.
The single exception to that is the $+$ binary operation,
that can be performed between two integers or between two \textit{strings}.
The resulting type of a semantically valid binary operation is the primitive type int,
with the single exception of adding two strings, where the resulting type is a string.
Table \ref{Table_Code_Examples_Binary_Operations} summarizes these facts.

% SUB-SECTION :: Scope Rules %

\subsection{Scope Rules}
\label{subsection_Scope_Rules}
\paragraph{RioMare} defines four kinds of scopes:
block scopes of if and while statements,
function scopes,
class scopes and
the outermost global scope.
When an identifier is being used at some point in the program,
its declaration is searched for in all of its enclosing scopes.
The search starts from the innermost scope, 
and ends at the outermost (global) scope.
\paragraph{Note} that array type declarations and
class type declarations can only be defined
in the outermost (global) scope.
Class type names and array type names must be different than any
previously defined variable names, function names, class type names,
array type names, primitive type names (int and string) and library function names
(PrintInt and PrintString).
\paragraph{Functions} can be defined only in the class scopes, and the global scope.
When a function is defined in the global scope, its name must be different than
any class type name, array type name, previously defined functions in the global scope,
primitive type names (int and string) and library function names (PrintInt and PrintString).
Following the same reason in \ref{Table_Code_Examples_Use_Before_Def},
functions may only refer to previously defined types, variables and functions.
When a function is being called inside a class scope, the declaration
of a function with that name is searched first in its class scope.
If no such function is found, the search moves to the global scope,
and if the declaration is missing there too, a semantic error is issued.
Following the same reason, when a function is being called inside the global scope,
only the global scope is searched for its declaration.
\paragraph{Resolving} a variable identifier
follows the same principal, with the slight difference that variables can be declared
in all four kinds of scopes.
Table \ref{Table_Code_Examples_Scope_Rules} summarizes these facts.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SUB-SECTION :: Library Functions %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Library Functions}
\label{subsection_Library_Functions}
RioMare defines two library functions: PrintInt and PrintString.\\
The signatures of these functions are as follows:\\ \\
\verb"void PrintInt(int i)      { ... }"\\ 
\verb"void PrintString(string s){ ... }"\\
